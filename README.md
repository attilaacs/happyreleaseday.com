# Build it and they'll come. 
I think this might be a blog. or a log. on the web. with thoughts

I'm currently making the first version of this app and I'm not sure what it'll be or if it will work. It's a very strange thing to chat in the command line and have Claude Code write things that I test and ask it to fix. There's a part of it that seems very familiar but it's odd to not have the skill to directly edit or fix things (yet). 

## TO DO: 
- work out how to backtrack some of the things I went through to get to the current version.
